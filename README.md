# Scrolling Background Effect

This is a simple scrolling background effect built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

When the user scrolls down the page, the background image gradually fades and changes its size. This creates a smooth visual effect and makes the page feel more interactive.

## Features

* Background image changes on scroll
* Smooth fade effect using opacity
* Dynamic background resizing
* Simple and clean design

## What I Learned

While building this project, I practiced:

* Working with the scroll event
* Using window.pageYOffset
* Updating CSS styles with JavaScript
* Controlling opacity dynamically
* Creating simple animation effects

This project helped me understand how user actions like scrolling can be used to create modern UI effects.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How It Works

* JavaScript listens for the scroll event
* It checks how far the user has scrolled
* The opacity of the background image decreases gradually
* The background size changes based on scroll position
* This creates a fade and zoom effect

## How to Use

1. Open the project in your browser
2. Scroll down the page
3. Watch the background image fade and resize smoothly
